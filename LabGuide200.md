# Lab 200 - Creating ICS Connections

## Introduction

This is the second of several labs that are part of the **ICS HCM Development Workshop**.

In this lab, you will learn how to create a basic ICS connection, using a basic orchestration.

## Objectives

- Create your first FTP and SOAP connections to later be used in the Integration that will be created in Lab 300.

## Required Artifacts

- The following lab and an Oracle Public Cloud account that will be supplied by your instructor.

### **STEP 1**: Login to ICS Home Page

>***NOTE:*** the **User Name** and **Password** values will be given to you by your instructor. See _Lab 100 **1.1.1**: Login to your Oracle Cloud Account_ for more information on how to sign into the ICS home page

### **STEP 5**: Creating an FTP Connection

- Go to the cloud dashboard page and click on **Integration** service. Ex: https://myservices.us2.oraclecloud.com/mycloud/faces/dashboard.jspx

Every domain will have FTP server associated with it. We will use this FTP server to host our files.


  ![](images/200/image086.png)

- Check the Additional Information. The FTP server details are given.

Copy Domain SFTP User Name, Host, port, and save it somewhere.

**Domain SFTP User Name:**
**SFTP Host:**
**Port:**


This will be the FTP user which is used in FTP connection creation.

  ![](images/200/image087.png)

- You can also access this info by clicking  on **Users** on the top right  ->SFTP Users  Username

  ![](images/200/image088.png)

- Now click on the SFTP Users in the panel to see the users with Secure FTP user accounts.

  ![](images/200/image089.png)

  ![](images/200/image091.png)

Now click on the **Connections**

  ![](images/200/image005.png)

- On the top bar click on **Create** to bring up the menu to create a new Connection.

  ![](images/200/image130.png)

The following prompt should pop up. Either scroll down and select or search for "FTP"

  ![](images/200/image131.png)

- The following screen should display when you click to create a new FTP Connection.

  ![](images/200/image133.png)


- In the **Name** field enter "ICSHCM-POC-FTP_UserXX" and replace the "XX" with your assigned user name.

Set the Role to **Trigger and Invoke**


- Click on **Configure Connectivity**. Use the
Domain **SFTP Host** as **FTP server host address** from step **1.2** which was retrieved from dashboard, without the port included.

Enter the **Port** as found in step **1.2**. It is most likely **22**.

Set the **SFTP Connection** to **True**.

Port : 22
SFTP connection: True

Then click **Ok** to close.

  ![](images/200/image134.png)

- Scroll down the same page and then click on the **Configure Security**. This will bring up the prompt to configure your FTP Security.

  ![](images/200/image135.png)

- You will now be asked to create the Security credentials for your FTP connection.

Leave the **Security Policy** as **FTP Server Access Policy**, or else change it if something else is selected.

For the **User Name** use the **Domain SFTP User Name** that you previously saved from step **4.2**.

In the **Password** field user the password that you originally used to log into Oracle Cloud provided by the instructor. It will be the password for either the cloud.admin or UserXX users.

Now click on **Ok** to close the prompt.

  ![](images/200/image136.png)
