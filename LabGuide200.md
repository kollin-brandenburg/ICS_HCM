## Required Artifacts

- The following lab and an Oracle Public Cloud account that will be supplied by your instructor.

## Login to your Oracle Cloud account

### Login to ICS Home Page

>***NOTE:*** the **User Name** and **Password** values will be given to you by your instructor. See _Lab 100 **1.1.1**: Login to your Oracle Cloud Account_ for more information on how to sign into the ICS home page

## Creating Simple Orchestration Integration

### Create Talent Profile SOAP Input Connection

This connection is used to call the importAndLoadData operation of the HCM Data Loader SOAP API. Its WSDL URL points to an HCM Cloud instance in Oracle’s demo environment.


**1.1** Click on the **Connections** section

![](images/200/image002.png)

**1.2** Click on **Create** in the upper right of the screen

![](images/200/image003.png)

**1.3** Select the **SOAP** Connection, by either doing a search, or by scrolling down to the **SOAP** connection, by clicking on the **Select** button of the **SOAP** connection.

![](images/200/image139.png)

**1.4** Fill in the information for the new connection

- **Name** in the form of _ICSHCM_SOAP_TalentProfile_Input_UserXX_ where XX is the number in your allocated user.
- **Role** _Trigger_ since we going to use the connection as an trigger the start of an integration

**1.5** click **Create**

![](images/200/image141.png)


**1.6** Click on the connection you just created. It opens up the window for you to configure different properties for the adapter.

![](images/200/image1000.png)

We need to access the file "TalentProfile.wsdl" for our next step. The file is located in the Artifacts folder given as part of the workshop by the instructor. Please make sure you have the file before moving on to next step.

**1.7** Click on **Configure Connectivity** under **Connection Properties** section.
Check the box under the **Upload File** column.
Then click on the **Upload Button**

Open up the folder Artifacts that was provided to you and locate the file "TalentProfile.wsdl".
Select this file and click **OK**.

Then click **Ok** to close.

**1.8** Scroll down the same page and then click on the **Configure Security** under the **Security** section. This will bring up the prompt to configure your SOAP Security.


**1.9** You will now be asked to create the Security credentials for your SOAP connection.

Leave the **Security Policy** as **Username Password Token**, or else change it if something else is selected.

This is what is required to login to Integration Cloud Service

Now click on **Ok** to close the prompt.

### Creating an FTP Connection

**1.1** Go to the cloud dashboard page and click on **Integration** service. Ex: https://myservices.us2.oraclecloud.com/mycloud/faces/dashboard.jspx

Every domain will have FTP server associated with it. We will use this FTP server to host our files.


![](images/200/image086.png)

**1.2** Check the Additional Information. The FTP server details are given.

Copy Domain SFTP User Name, Host, port, and save it somewhere.

**Domain SFTP User Name:**
**SFTP Host:**
**Port:**


This will be the FTP user which is used in FTP connection creation.

![](images/200/image087.png)

**1.3** You can also access this info by clicking  on **Users** on the top right  ->SFTP Users  Username

![](images/200/image088.png)

**1.4** Now click on the SFTP Users in the panel to see the users with Secure FTP user accounts.

![](images/200/image089.png)

**1.5** Navigate back to the ICS console

![](images/200/image090.png)

![](images/200/image091.png)

Now click on the **Connections**

![](images/200/image092.png)

**1.6** On the top bar click on **Create** to bring up the menu to create a new Connection.

![](images/200/image130.png)

The following prompt should pop up. Either scroll down and select or search for "FTP"

![](images/200/image131.png)

**1.7** The following screen should display when you click to create a new FTP Connection.

![](images/200/image133.png)


**1.8** In the **Name** field enter "ICSHCM-POC-FTP_UserXX" and replace the "XX" with your assigned user name.

Set the Role to **Trigger and Invoke**


**1.9** Click on **Configure Connectivity**. Use the
Domain **SFTP Host** as **FTP server host address** from step **1.2** which was retrieved from dashboard, without the port included.

Enter the **Port** as found in step **1.2**. It is most likely **22**.

Set the **SFTP Connection** to **True**.

Port : 22
SFTP connection: True

Then click **Ok** to close.

![](images/200/image134.png)

**1.10** Scroll down the same page and then click on the **Configure Security**. This will bring up the prompt to configure your FTP Security.

![](images/200/image135.png)

**1.11** You will now be asked to create the Security credentials for your FTP connection.

Leave the **Security Policy** as **FTP Server Access Policy**, or else change it if something else is selected.

For the **User Name** use the **Domain SFTP User Name** that you previously saved from step **1.2**.

In the **Password** field user the password that you originally used to log into Oracle Cloud. It will be the password for either the cloud.admin or UserXX users.

Now click on **Ok** to close the prompt.
